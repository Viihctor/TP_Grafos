The dataset consists of 4 folders:

1.Gabrel Example: 
- This dataset is for the example given by Gabrel in the paper "QoS-aware automatic syntactic service composition problem: Complexity and resolution.".
- This folder contains 2 files:
 1- Original Web Service Repository by Gabrel: the original XML file showing the services` repository with their corresponding input and output parameters.
 2- Generated SDG by MISD Model: contains XML file for the generated service dependency graph (SDG) by MISD model.
